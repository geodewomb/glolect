Julian immediately tried to use keyboard left/right arrow keys to navigate. Might want to consider adding that?

When the scripture is too long to fit in the column it breads kind of oddly--like at the dash between verses.  It would probably be easier to read it it did something different, like break after commas.  I don't know how hard that would be.  

Did you scroll clear down to the bottom of the Sundays and feast days page?  Something very odd is clearly happening.

Nothing to be done about it, but if you just click week after week a few time, the fact that the triangles change their direction is kinda disorienting...

[old] On my phone the page won't scroll, so I can't get at the week.  Also the triangle overlaps the words below it.  But I can use the daily scripture links.

on my computer, using Chrome, when I refresh, so it knows it's today, it doesn't reset the week I was looking at to the current week.  


DONE

Also you should add a favicon. Maybe the current triangle icon?
